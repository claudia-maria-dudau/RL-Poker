<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project we explored the basic reinformcent learning arlogirtms (SARSA, Expected SARSA, Q Learning) and some based on neural networks (DQN and its variants) to see how each algorithm would perform in a game of poker. Our objective was to find the best model with whom to play the game.

The models were trained agains the random model which comes with the enviroment, to avoid the possibility of them to learn the patter of their adversary rather than developing a true strategy for the game. Each model has its own logic and learning mechanism on which it bases its behavior.
